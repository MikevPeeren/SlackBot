# SlackBot

This is a SlackBot created to manage environments inside Slack, but can be adjusted to include more commands. It is in use by the DUUK team from Blink.

It has the following commands:

- `/environment_check`
- `/environment_use [staging, feature1, feature2]`
- `/environment_free [staging, feature1, feature2]`
